Project
=======

"Please Computer | Design Make Me" was originally the source package for the "Screen Party" of April 22, 2010 at ESAPV Mons, proposed by Open Source Publishing.
"Please Computer | Design Make Me" is an introduction to the command line through graphic design, writing and concrete poetry.
This package gathers reference texts, tutorials and a collection of scripts. It was created to facilitate collaboration, but also to be increased later on, for example through other workshops.



Getting Started
===============

- Place this folder in your working folder
- Open a Terminal window
    - On MacOS:
      - Go to Applications/Utilities/Terminal
- Go into your working folder (telling the path to your terminal):
    $ cd /Volumes/your-hard-drive/.../your-folder/
    (`cd` stands for 'change directory')
      - *TIP* The TAB key allows you to auto-complete folder names and file, so you do not need to know the hard disk tree and file names by heart!
- Go to the 'scripts' folder in the "PleaseMakeMeDesign" package 
    $ cd pleasemakemedesign/scripts


Alternative way
(Avoid writing the whole path by hand)
--------------------------------------
- Place this file in your working folder
- Open a Terminal window
    - On MacOS:
      - Go to Applications/Utilities/Terminal
    - On Ubuntu:
      - Go to Applications/Accessories/Terminal
- Type `cd ` (space is important !)
- Find the package folder in the Finder 
- Drag and drop this folder in the Terminal
- Press Enter


Tips
====
- `../` means higher folder
- type `-h` or `--help` after the name of a program allows to view the help text


Experiment
============

You can now test the command lines described in the file 'references/initiation.html' or 'recipes/dutch_way.html'
Do not be afraid of losing files or launch a dangerous command. Besides the orders `rm` and `>`, nothing changes your files.
`rm` deletes a file (use with caution because the file is deleted directly without going through the trash !).
The command `>` saves the output in a file.

- To call a file located in a subfolder, type :
    $ mon-dossier/mon-fichier.txt
- To call a file in a folder above, type :
    $ ../my-file.txt
