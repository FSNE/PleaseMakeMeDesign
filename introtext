These embodied two fundamentally different approaches to computing. When you
were using cards, you'd punch a whole stack of them and run them through the
reader all at once, which was called batch processing. You could also do batch
processing with a teletype, as I have already described, by using the paper
tape reader, and we were certainly encouraged to use this approach when I was
in high school. But--though efforts were made to keep us unaware of this--the
teletype could do something that the card reader could not. On the teletype,
once the modem link was established, you could just type in a line and hit the
return key. The teletype would send that line to the computer, which might or
might not respond with some lines of its own, which the teletype would hammer
out--producing, over time, a transcript of your exchange with the machine.
This way of doing it did not even have a name at the time, but when, much
later, an alternative became available, it was retroactively dubbed the
Command Line Interface.
